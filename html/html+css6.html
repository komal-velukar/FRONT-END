    <p>Spring Tutorial
Last Updated : 23 Jul, 2025
Spring Framework is a comprehensive and versatile platform for enterprise Java development. It is known for its Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) capabilities that simplify creating modular and testable applications. Key features include Spring MVC for web development, Spring Boot for rapid application setup, and Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization. With a rich ecosystem covering Spring Data for database interactions and Spring Cloud for building microservices, Spring supports scalable and resilient enterprise solutions, making it an essential framework for developers of all experience levels.

In this Spring tutorial , you'll explore Spring’s robust infrastructure to build scalable , high-performing applications . Covering essential topics like dependency injection, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot , as well as advanced areas such as Spring Data, Spring AOP, and Spring Security. Whether you're building web applications with Spring MVC or using Spring Boot for rapid development, this guide offers practical examples and real-world projects for beginners and experienced professionals.

What is Spring Framework?
Spring is a lightweight and popular open-source Java-based framework developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. It is used to develop enterprise-level applications. It provides support to many other frameworks such as Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, Struts, etc. so it is also called a framework of frameworks. It’s an application framework and IOC (Inversion of Control) container for the Java platform. The spring contains several modules like IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, WEB MVC, etc.

Why to use Spring?
Spring framework is a Java platform that is open source. Rod Johnson created it, and it was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. When it comes to size and transparency, Spring is a featherweight. Spring framework's basic version is about 2MB in size. The Spring Framework's core capabilities can be used to create any Java program, however there are modifications for constructing web applications on top of the Java EE platform. By offering a POJO-based programming model, the Spring framework aims to make J2EE development easier to use and to promote good programming habits.

Applications of Spring
POJO Based: Spring allows developers to use POJOs to create enterprise-class apps. The advantage of using simply POJOs is that you don't require an EJB container product like an application server; instead, you may use a powerful servlet container like Tomcat or a commercial product.
Modular : Spring is set up in a modular approach. Even if there are a lot of packages and classes, you only need to worry about the ones you need and ignore the rest.
Integration with Existing Frameworks: Spring does not reinvent the wheel; rather, it makes extensive use of existing technologies such as numerous ORM frameworks, logging frameworks, JEE, Quartz, and JDK timers, and other view technologies.
Testability: Because environment-dependent code is put into this framework, testing a Spring-written application is trivial. Furthermore, using JavaBeanstyle POJOs makes it easier to employ dependency injection for injecting test data.
Web MVC: Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework that is an excellent alternative to web frameworks like Struts and other over-engineered or less popular web frameworks.
Central Exception Handling: Spring provides a handy API for converting technology-specific exceptions (such as those raised by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.
Lightweight: IoC containers are typically lightweight, especially when compared to EJB containers, for example. This is useful for creating and distributing programmers on systems with limited memory and CPU resources.

Core Spring
Core Spring focuses on the fundamental principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI). These concepts are crucial for decoupling components and managing object lifecycles. This section explores how Spring's IoC container and DI mechanisms work, providing examples and explanations.

Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications. It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their applications.

This Spring Boot Tutorial is a comprehensive guide that covers both basic and advanced concepts of the Spring Framework. It is designed for beginners as well as professionals.

Spring Boot, a module of the Spring framework, facilitates Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities.

This Spring tutorial includes basic to advanced topics of Spring Boot, like Basics of Spring Boot, Spring Boot core, Spring Boot REST API, Spring Boot with Microservices, Spring Boot with Kafka, Spring Boot with Database and Data JPA, etc.

What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used to create a Micro Service. Spring boot is developed by Pivotal Team, and it provides a faster way to set up and an easier, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications. It is a combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers. The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time and in Spring Boot, there is no requirement for XML configuration.

Prerequisite of Spring Boot
Understanding of Java syntax and core concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling
Basic understanding of the Spring framework
